# E-Waste-Generation-Classification

E-Waste Generation Classification using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Project Overview:
This project aims to classify e-waste generation using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language and Jupyter Notebook as the development environment.

Project Structure
- data/: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- models/: Directory containing the implemented machine learning and deep learning models.
- notebooks/: Directory containing the Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- utils/: Directory containing utility functions used throughout the project.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Coder-1409/E-Waste-Generation-Classification
2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook

Usage
1. Open the notebooks/ directory and select the notebook you want to run.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to explore the data, develop, and evaluate the models.
3. Use the models/ directory to access the implemented models and make predictions.

Models
- Machine Learning Models:
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Deep Learning Models:
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
